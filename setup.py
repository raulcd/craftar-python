"""CraftAR Python Library
==========================

The CraftAR Python Library allows you to integrate
`CraftAR Image Recognition`_ in your applications and services.

This client library provides access to our APIs:

-  `CraftAR Recognition API` allows visual recognition against one of
   your collections of reference images specified using the
   collection token.
-  `CraftAR Management API` allows upload and management of
   collections of reference images. All requests must be
   authenticated using your management api key.

The library also provides tools for performing batch operations:

-  `craftar\_search`, for image recognition.
-  `craftar\_upload`, for batch upload of images.

To use our service you need a `CraftAR`_ account.

You can get our `code`_, check the `README`_ and file bugs in the
`issue tracker`_.
